# Mole
Molecular Visualizer for macOS
Implemented in Apple Swift. Provides balls & sticks display mode in Particle & Amino colour modes

Built for running on macOS Mojave with Swift 4.2, updated frequently to make sure that it always works as it should. Also I took into consideration the NSTouchBar, so it has a great use case now - it switches between modes.

Great thanks to PorridgeBear for his IMVS project - I updated it to work with swift 4.2 and based this app mostly on it.
